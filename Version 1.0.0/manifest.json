So I thank everyone who has helped me there. here is a discord link for there server if you wanna join and show your support to them!\n\nhttps://discord.gg46JUdQb\n\nMy entire community as a whole! Giving me ideas on what to change and how to improve on the ideas I already have implemented!\n\nVersion History!\n\nVersion 1.0.0\nChanges that were made:\n\n- Food rework! Cooked foods now heal you like in the Java Edition of Minecraft when eaten! Uncooked meat foods also have a chance to poison you but have the same hunger gain as cooked foods (Except for the saturation, uncooked foods will also give you less saturation!) Foods now take usually much longer or shorter to eat! But give you a more meaningful impact to your hunger and saturation depending on the food type!\n\n- Stews Rework! Rabbit Stew, Mushroom Stew, and beetroot stew now each give different effects upon eating them! Mushroom stew give regeneration 1 for 15 seconds, beetroot stew gives resistance 1 for 15 seconds, and rabbit stew gives jump boost 1 for 15 seconds! All 3 stews are also instant eat as well and are stackable up to 8!(Now with an enchanted tint as a cherry on top ;) )\n\n- Enchanted Golden Apples and Golden apples rework! Both types of gaps now give much more intense effects but for an shortened amount of time, as well as both being able to be instantly eaten!\n\nEnchanted Apples effects are as follows,\n\nResistance 4: 5 Seconds\nStrength 4: 5 Seconds\nRegeneration 10: 3 Seconds\nAbsorption 4: 10 Seconds\n\nGolden Apples effects are as follows,\n\nResistance 2: 5 Seconds\nStrength 2: 5 Seconds\nRegeneration 6: 1 Second\nAbsorption 2: 10 Seconds\n\n- Chorus Fruits Rework! Chorus fruits now have no cooldown and are instant eat! However they dont give any hunger at all and the teleport was nerfed from an 8x8x8 to a 4x4x4 area!\n\n- Totem of Undying buff! Now has a passive regeneration 1 and health boost 3 when equipped in your off hand!\n\n- Reworked some mobs! Charged Creepers now have a rare chance to natually spawn! (1 out of 100 chance!) and husks will now poison you rather than give you hunger, making them more of a threat rather than a minor inconvinence!\n\n- Reworked Potions! Now regular potions will stack up to 8 and can be drinked much much faster! Splash and lingering potions have recieved a massive increase of range of which they can be thrown! Making them much more effective as ranged weapons or support items for your friends! Lingering potions now have a sped up time for when they reapply effects! Also being stackable up to 16!\n\n- Ender Pearl Rework! Now being able to be thrown a bit more of a farther distance!\n\n- Added some originally uncraftable items! here they are!\n\nSaddles can be craftable now! from leather, iron ingots and iron nuggets!\n\nChainmail armor now can be made from chains\n\nMonster Spawners can be crafted from iron bars!\n\nZombie, Creeper, Skeleton, and Wither Skeleton mob eggs can now be crafted from mob heads and eggs! (Pssttt, You get mob heads from charged creepers in case yha dint know ;) )\n\nElytra's are now craftable from some string, popped chorus fruit, leather, feathers and phantom membranes!\n\nAll horse armors are now craftable with leather horse armor and then the armor's material around the leather horse armor!\n\nEnchanted Golden Apples are now craftable with 8 gold blocks around a golden apple!\n\nTotem of Undying's are now craftable with a gold helmet, 3 gold blocks, an enchanted golden apple, and 2 emeralds!\n\nChains are now crafted using 3 nuggets instead of 2 nuggets and 1 iron ingot!",
